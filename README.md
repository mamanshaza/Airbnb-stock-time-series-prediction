Airbnb Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to the Airbnb Stock Price Prediction project! The goal of this project is to predict the future stock prices of Airbnb using historical stock data and time series analysis.
Data

The data used in this project is historical stock data for Airbnb from the beginning of their public trading in December 2020 until present. The data includes information such as date, opening price, closing price, and trading volume.
Methods

The main method used in this project is the SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) model, which is a type of time series analysis model that takes into account both seasonality and trends in the data. Other time series analysis methods such as ARIMA and Holt-Winters were also explored and compared to SARIMAX.
Results

The SARIMAX model was able to accurately predict future stock prices for Airbnb with a high degree of accuracy. The model's predictions were compared to the actual closing prices and had a low mean absolute error.
Usage

The code for this project can be found in the airbnb_stock_price_prediction.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains all the code and explanations for data cleaning, model selection, and model evaluation. The necessary libraries are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodel, and matplotlib.


Conclusion

Overall, this project demonstrates that using time series analysis methods such as SARIMAX can provide accurate predictions of future stock prices for Airbnb. This can be useful for investors and traders in making informed decisions about buying or selling Airbnb stock.
